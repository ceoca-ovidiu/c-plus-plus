### [Exercise 1](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/1/exercise1.cpp)

Determine if a number is prime or not

**Example**:

1. n = 3

> The number is prime

2. n = 2

> The number is prime

3. n = -12

> The number is not prime

4. n = 49

> The number is not prime

5. n = 0

> The number is prime

### [Exercise 2](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/2/exercise2.cpp)

Write a C++ method that print the biggest number that can be written with the numbers of an entered natural number

**Example**:

### [Exercise 3](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/3/exercise3.cpp)

Write a C++ method called primeDiff which receives as the only parameter, n, a natural number with max 9 characters and
return the minimum diff p2-p1 where p1 and p2 are prime numbers and p1 ≤ n ≤ p2.

**Example**: n = 28 p1 = 23 and p2 = 29 => result = 6;

### [Exercise 4](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/4/exercise4.cpp)

From an n elements vector (natural numbers), delete all the elements that are prime

**Example**:

### [Exercise 5](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/5/exercise5.cpp)

Write a C++ program that reads from keyboard a natural number (except 0) n. Build a two-dimensional block of n dimension
where each element is equal to the last character of indexes product

**Example**:

### [Exercise 6](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/6/exercise6.cpp)

Write a program that reads from the keyboard a natural number different from 0 with maximum of 9 characters and build a
two-dimensional square matrix with the dimension of the length of n filled with the characters of n.

**Example**:

### [Exercise 7](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/7/exercise7.cpp)

From a given array, determine the sum of all the prime numbers from that array

**Example**:

### [Exercise 8](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/8/exercise8.cpp)

Given n (natural number), display in ascending order, the array elements of Fibonacci smaller or equal than n

**Example**:

### [Exercise 9](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/9/exercise9.cpp)

Write a C++ method which finds the biggest and the smallest character of a natural number sent as parameter. The method
will return the results with the help of outputs parameters.

**Example**:

### [Exercise 10](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/10/exercise10.cpp)

The factorial of an entered natural number

**Example**:

1. n = 5

> The factorial of number 5 is: 120

### [Exercise 11]()

Calculate the factorial of a number n, recursively

**Example**:

1. n = 5

> The factorial of number 5 is: 120

### [Exercise 12]()

Write a recursive C++ method which return the number of zeros in a number passed as parameter

**Example**:

1. n = 123

> The number of zeros in number 123 is: 0

2. n = 1010

> The number of zeros in number 1010 is: 2

3. n = -120

> The number of zeros in number -120 is: 1

### [Exercise 13]()

Write a recursive C++ method which returns the sum of all the characters from a natural number passed as parameter

**Example**:

1. n = 23

> The sum of the characters of the number: 23 is: 5

2. n = 0

> The sum of the characters of the number: 0 is: 0

3. n = -56

> The sum of the characters of the number: -56 is: 11

4. n = 54.67

> The sum of the characters of the number: 54 is: 9

### [Exercise 14]()

Write a recursive C++ method which returns the biggest character of a number passed as parameter

**Example**:

1. n = 67

> The biggest character of the number 67 is 7

2. n = -23

> The biggest character of the number -23 is 3

3. n = 0

> The biggest character of the number 0 is 0

4. n = 98.34

> The biggest character of the number 98 is 9

5. n = 22

> The biggest character of the number 22 is 2

### [Exercise 15]()

Write a recursive C++ method which returns the smallest character of a number passed as parameter

**Example**:

1. n = 67

> The smallest character of the number 67 is 6

2. n = -23

> The smallest character of the number -23 is 2

3. n = 0

> The smallest character of the number 0 is 0

4. n = 98.34

> The smallest character of the number 98 is 8

5. n = 22

> The smallest character of the number 22 is 2
