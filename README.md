### [Exercise 1](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/1/exercise1.cpp)
Determine if a number is prime or not

**Example**:

### [Exercise 2](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/2/exercise2.cpp)

Write a C++ method that print the biggest number that can be written with the numbers of an entered natural number

**Example**:

### [Exercise 3](https://github.com/ceoca-ovidiu/c-plus-plus/blob/main/3/exercise3.cpp)

Write a C++ method called primeDiff which receives as the only parameter, n, a natural number with max 9 characters and return the minimum diff p2-p1 where p1 and p2 are prime numbers and p1 ≤ n ≤ p2.

**Example**: n = 28 p1 = 23 and p2 = 29 => result = 6;

### [Exercise 4]()

From an n elements vector (natural numbers), delete all the elements that are prime

**Example**:

### [Exercise 5]()

Write a C++ program that reads from keyboard a natural number (except 0) n. Build a two-dimensional block of n dimension where each element is equal to the last character  of indexes product

**Example**:

### [Exercise 6]()

Write a program that reads from the keyboard a natural number different from 0 with maximum of 9 characters and build a two-dimensional square matrix with the dimension of the length of n filled with the characters of n.

**Example**:

### [Exercise 7]()

From a given array, determine the sum of all the prime numbers from that array

**Example**:

### [Exercise 8]()

Given n (natural number), display in ascending order, the array elements of Fibonacci smaller or equal than n

**Example**:

### [Exercise 9]()

Write a C++ method which finds the biggest and the smallest character of a natural number sent as parameter. The method will return the results with the help of outputs parameters.

**Example**:

### [Exercise 10]()

The factorial of an entered number

**Example**:
